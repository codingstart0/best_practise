#Task
You have to create a simple function — chooseName() — that prints a random name from the provided array (names) to the provided paragraph (para), and then run it once.

#Additional task
In this task, you return to the problem again, with the aim of improving it. The three improvements we want you to make are:

Refactor the code that generates the random number into a separate function called random(), which takes as parameters two generic bounds that the random number should be between, and returns the result.
Update the chooseName() function so that it makes use of the random number function, takes the array to choose from as a parameter (making it more flexible), and returns the result.
Print the returned result into the paragraph (para)'s textContent.
