#A basic todo app Vanilla JavaScript.

Created based on Bootstrap and Tailwind.

It is often said that one of the ways to really get better at programming is by building projects. And CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) apps are one way to improve your coding skills as a developer. In this task, we are going to build a straightforward Todo List app. Letâ€™s dive right into it..

#TASK

1. Add id using UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) to auto increment todos index.
2. Simplified App leaving only todo list without additional task.
3. Add btn hide done task. Google it how to hide in JS
4. Change standart alert mesage to bootstrap component Modal
5. replace .innerText into todo.id that item gets from array by ID, but not from html DOM.

#BUG
